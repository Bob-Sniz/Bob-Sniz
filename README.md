- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bob-Sniz (Robert Muriithi officialy).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning several things such as programming in cpp, python and java, Learning how to grey-hat hack (preferably red teaming).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, cpp languages and dart on flutter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming mostly and still open to other interesting stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me : nderitumuriithi1@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: : "He", "Him".
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe a computer is a dumb machine not comparable to a human brain,  but our brains depend more on them to simplify tasks.
